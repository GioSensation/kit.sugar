kit.sugar
=========

Add html syntax highlighting for .kit files in Espresso.app.

Espresso automatically detects html syntax for .kit files when they have an opening `<html>` tag, but it does not for partials (ie. when `<html>` is not declared). This sugar solves the issue.

In the future I might add more functionality such as .kit statements detection and coloring (`@import`, `$variables`, etc), but not for now. Feel free to fork and contribute to this if you feel like it.

Hope this helps someone.

## Instalation

1. Download and extract zip if the browser doesn't do this for you
2. Rename folder kit.sugar
3. Double click the .sugar file
4. Restart Espresso - magic!
